# New Project Launch: Elevate Your Company with Generative Artificial Intelligence! 🌟

Greetings Gıthub Community! 👋

I am thrilled to announce the launch of an exciting project - the **Stable Diffusion Model**! This groundbreaking initiative allows us to elevate a brand's product from the ordinary to a visual masterpiece. With the capability to transform any image and generate ad templates, our project is set to redefine visual content creation.

🚀 **Project Access:**
You can access the project through the Kubernetes service at [http://34.171.84.58/](http://34.171.84.58/).

## Technologies Used in the Project:

### 🧠 Artificial Neural Network:
Harnessing the power of the Stable Diffusion Pipeline, our project boasts the ability to generate visual content based on visual cues. Additionally, we've integrated a robust artificial neural network model to predict color names from hexadecimal (hex) codes, making the inclusion of specific colors in visual content more accessible and effective.

### ❇ FastAPI and HTML Integration:
The project's speed and visual appeal are enhanced through the seamless integration of FastAPI and HTML. This not only ensures rapid and efficient functionality but also delivers an aesthetically pleasing user experience.

### 🐳 Docker:
Boosting portability, Docker packages our project into containers, isolating software and dependencies. This ensures seamless operation in various environments and efficient management of development, testing, and production environments.

### ☸ Kubernetes:
Leveraging Kubernetes, we effectively manage and scale our project. This platform automates deployment and management of containerized applications, allowing automatic scaling in the case of rapid growth, enhancing performance, and providing uninterrupted service.

## 🌟 Result: A Symphony of Colors and Technological Precision!
Experience the fusion of Stable Diffusion's creative prowess and FastAPI's rapid processing, resulting in a symphony of colors and technological precision. The outcome? An innovative project that redefines the boundaries of visual creation.

*Note: Please be aware that the image generation process takes 7-8 minutes due to CPU processing.*
